# Marco ───

How can I list all files of a certain type prevously committed in a github repository? I might have removed these files in local memeory but my repository has a huge size still so I would like to list all files of tyoe `.pth` that were previously committed

#  Copilot ───

To list all files of a certain type (e.g., `.pth`) that were previously committed in a GitHub repository, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git log --all --pretty=format: --name-only | grep '\.pth$'
```

This command does the following:
1. `git log --all --pretty=format: --name-only`: Lists all files that have ever been committed in the repository.
2. `grep '\.pth$'`: Filters the list to show only files with the `.pth` extension.

Run this command in the root directory of your Git repository.

How can I remove all files of a certain type (e.g., `.pth`) from a GitHub repository past commits?

#  Copilot ───

To remove all files of a certain type (e.g., `.pth`) from past commits in a GitHub repository, you can use the `git filter-repo` tool. This tool is more powerful and safer than the older `git filter-branch`. Here are the steps:

1. **Install `git filter-repo`**:
   ```sh
   pip install git-filter-repo
   ```

2. **Run `git filter-repo` to remove `.pth` files**:
   ```sh
   git filter-repo --path-glob '*.pth' --invert-paths
   ```

This command does the following:
- `--path-glob '*.pth'`: Specifies the pattern of files to be removed.
- `--invert-paths`: Inverts the path filter to remove the specified files instead of keeping them.

3. **Force push the changes to the remote repository**:
   ```sh
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

**Note**: This operation rewrites the commit history. It is a destructive operation and will change commit hashes. Make sure to inform your team and coordinate accordingly, as everyone will need to re-clone the repository or reset their local branches.

4. **Clean up any remaining references**:
   ```sh
   git push origin --force --tags
   git for-each-ref --format='delete %(refname)' refs/original | git update-ref --stdin
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   ```

This ensures that all references to the old history are removed and the repository is cleaned up.

# Marco ───

Does this erase other changes already committed after the selected files to be removed?

#  Copilot ───

Using `git filter-repo` to remove specific files (e.g., `.pth` files) from the commit history will rewrite the entire commit history, but it will not erase other changes. Instead, it will create a new history that excludes the specified files while preserving other changes.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens:

1. **Identify and Remove Files**: `git filter-repo` identifies all instances of the specified files (`*.pth` in this case) in the commit history and removes them.
2. **Rewrite History**: The commit history is rewritten to exclude the specified files. All other changes and commits are preserved, but their hashes will change because the history is rewritten.
3. **Force Push**: You need to force push the rewritten history to the remote repository, which will overwrite the existing history on the remote.

To summarize, the process will:
- Remove the specified files from all commits.
- Preserve other changes and commits.
- Change commit hashes due to history rewriting.

Here is the command again for clarity:

```sh
git filter-repo --path-glob '*.pth' --invert-paths
```

And the steps to force push and clean up:

```sh
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
git for-each-ref --format='delete %(refname)' refs/original | git update-ref --stdin
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

**Important**: Coordinate with your team before performing this operation, as it will require everyone to re-clone or reset their local repositories.
